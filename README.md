# tree-sitter-teal

It's a tree-sitter parser for tealâ„¢

Specifically, this is a parser for the [type-declaration](https://github.com/teal-language/tl/tree/type-declaration) branch of [Teal](https://github.com/teal-language/tl)

# Help appreciated

I (euclidianAce) am not super familiar with how tree-sitter is used, so pull requests and more contributors are welcome.
